  * `for...of` works in terms of `.iterator()` and `.next()` and `use @@iterator property`

* `let / const` 
  * **let** & **const** are `hoisted` but `not initialised`.
    * The lexically declared variables however stay uninitialised. 
    * **var** is `hoisted` and `initialised with undefined`.
  * `ReferenceError exception` is thrown when you try to access it.
  *
  * `Temporal Dead Zone` is everything (trying to access variable) before `let/const/class` statement is evaluated/initialised.
*
* Arrow function
* Spread syntax (splat operator)
* Promise
